# What is it?

* Actor model
* Capabilities-secure
* high-performance

programming Language

???
Actor oriented programming language. Uses actors to model units of execution.
Capabilities used for describing manners in which references can be used.
Several features being described below result in very high-performance, scalable language

---
# Hello world

```pony
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    env.out.print("Hello, world.")

```

???
Pretty straightforward, reads like traditional programming languages.
Let's break it down.
---

# Actors

--
```pony
actor Main```

???
Actors unit of execution. `Main` actor entry point
--
```pony
new create(env: Env) =>```

???
Constructors denoted with `new` keyword. environment passed in as argument
--
```pony
    env.out.print("Hello, world.")
```

???
`env.out` actor which has a behavior named `print`.

--
```pony
be sayHello(who: String) =>
    env.out.print("Hello, " + who)
```

???
Behaviors declared with `be` keyword. Asynchronous WRT caller. Queue for messages to actor.
Execution for each actor sequential.

---

# Classes

```pony
class val Env
...
  
  let out: StdStream
...
  
  new _create(
    argc: U32,
    argv: Pointer[Pointer[U8]] val,
    envp: Pointer[Pointer[U8]] val) =>
    @pony_os_stdout_setup[None]()
    out = StdStream._out()

  fun out(): StdStream => out

  fun ref set_stuff(to: U64 = 0): U64 => _stuff = to

```

???
Classes can have
* Constructors
* fields
* functions

`ref` means the object being called on must have ref type.

Local type inference, but functions args and return types must be specified

Everything is an operator. Assignment returns value from right.

Traits exist for nominal subtyping. Interfaces for structural typing
---

# Capabilities-secure

* Describe what cannot be done with reference
* Prevents reads during writes and writes during reads
* Guarantees lock free data exchange

???
`val` can never be modified so can be passed aroun
`ref` can be used locally, but can't be shared with others
Can `consume` variable signalling to the compiler that you're done using the object


---

# Functional

```pony
fun f(x: (U32 | String | None)): String =>
  match x
  | None => "none"
  | 3 => "three"
  | "5" => "not four"
  else
    "something else"
  end
```

???
Has several functional language features including

* algebraic data types (union, tuples)
* pattern matching with object decomposition
* Implicit return

---

# FFI

```c
typedef void(*CB)(void*, int);
```

```pony
use "path:./"
use "lib:ffi-callbacks"
type CB is @{(Env, I32)}
```

???
Use the `use` syntax to reference native code.

Declare type corresponding to native types
--
```c
void do_callback(CB callback, void* env)
{
  callback(env, 10);
}
```

```pony
use @do_callback[None](fptr: CB, env: Env)
```

???
Match up the signatures for functions between C and pony
--
```pony
primitive Callback
  fun @callback(env: Env, i: I32) =>
    env.out.print(i.string())

...

@do_callback(addressof Callback.callback, env)
```
???
Trivial to go back and forth between Pony and native code
---

# Conclusion

* fawad@fawad.net
* [Pony Tutorial](https://tutorial.ponylang.org/)

???
Great language with huge number of desirable features.

Some rough edges

Gathering steam quickly

Tons of academic papers around concurrency, GC.
